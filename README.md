# React Boilerplate

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It uses `redux-observable` to maintain global state logic and for handling asynchronous task with the help of `rxjs` utilities. For design concerns, this project utilizes components from `material-ui` and `reakit` , `tailwindcss` is also the choice

### Libraries used:

- `redux-observable` - state management and asynchronous task handling with the help of `rxjs` .
- `material-ui` and `reakit` - components
- `tailwindcss`, `emotion` and `clsx` - styles
- `react-router` - routing

### Motivation

I wanted to have a consistent setup, very easy to use React based boilerplate that will kickstart every project that I worked on
